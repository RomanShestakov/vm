* Description

A Vagrant VM using Docker provider and provisioned with ansible.  This
VM is used for development purposes and uses Centos7.  Ansible roles
are used to build gcc, llvm and some other packages from sources.  I
want to be able to use the same environment using different CPU
archetectures - e.g. x86 or Apple M1 chip (aarch64) so the best way to
archive this is to use Docker as VirtualBox hypervisor doesn't work
for M1.
